The keys and certificates are generated by following openssl commands.

1, Create self-signed CA cert 
openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ca-key.pem -days 3560 -out ca-cert.pem -nodes

2, Create new key for server
openssl genrsa -out server-key.pem 2048

3, Generate CSR file
openssl req -new -key server-key.pem -out server-csr.pem 

4, Generate cert for server by private CA
openssl x509 -req -days 3560 -CA ca-cert.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -CAcreateserial -in server-csr.pem -out server-cert.pem

The client key and certificate are created with similar commands.

Check the content of the cert:
openssl x509 -in server-cert.pem -noout -text
